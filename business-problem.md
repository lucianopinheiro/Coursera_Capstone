## Business problem

Belém is an poor Amazon city and capital of Pará State, in Brazil. It has about 1.5 million residents. On the last decades, the city had a exponencial growth. But this growth was not organized. So, while some places had a good development, with lots of new big and small businness, others were simply forgotten or occupied in a illegal way.

The idea here is to explore the city trying to find the distribution of a particular businness over the city, trying to find some gaps, wich may help enterpreneurs to find places to start new businness.

We will demonstrate the solution with pharmacies. But you may notice that with just small changes, it will work with any sort of businness.
